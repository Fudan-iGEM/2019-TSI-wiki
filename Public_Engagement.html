Background of feral cats issue
-- Preface of Human Practice


Stray Cats

Emerging as a sometime neglected issue, stray cats affect both human society and ecology to a much larger extent than we assumed. Relevant organizations do provide astonishing details that allow us to infer how tremendous the number of stray cats is: every year, animal caring centers in the USA need to accommodate around 3,200,000 stray cats[1], and in Singapore, 2,274 stray cats were taken in 2017 just in one province. The leading cause of this enormous number is the desertion of household cats onto the street, allowing their progeny to join the army to roam down the road. (According to a study carried out by Tennessee State University and California university, )A fertile couple of stray cats could get born 420,000 kitties in the following seven years. The progeny of stray cats is the main reason for the rocketing number of street cats.



Astonishingly, stray cats also post an immense threat towards biodiversity, which is unrealized by the general public. Without human owners to provide food, feral cats have to rely on their predatory nature to survive, preying on smaller animals. In 2016, research published in Proceeding of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) suggested that invasive mammalian predators have contributed to 58% of the extinctions of birds, mammals, and reptiles globally over the past 500 years. Feral cats, as the leading perpetrators, are linked to the extinction of 63 species. With this knowledge, Dr. Doherty leading this research called for prioritised management of invasive predators to protect the vulnerable endemic species[2]. Moreover, research of the American Bird Conservation Association suggests that cats are the ‘second greatest killer’ of bird species, with the first one being habitat destruction.

Why is the cat so startled? Let’s check the next episode. The previous episode is about the interview of Fenghua Li, a well-known stray cat rescuer in Beijing, China’s capital.


Though, the reaction of people towards the surrounding street cats is not always kind. In 2016, an amount of 15 cats were found dead in a neighborhood, possibly poisoned by the dwellers; and in 2017, staffs in Shanxi Agricultural University were forced to chase away mobs of stray cats because they flocked inside to the campus and attacked students. Affairs of stray cats behaving aggressively to human or the other way around are countless in China nowadays that people are forced to take these incidents with high vigilance, urging to regulate the scale of stray cats. Inevitably, the battle will end with the fatigue of stray cats that no one wishes to see.


Trap, Neuter, Release

Trap-Neuter-Release (TNR) is the most accepted method for stray animals population control widely-accepted by major authorities, as it’s very plausible, effective and humane. The process of TNR, as stated by the name, includes: first, confining the animals so that caregivers could let them receive medical care, since vagabondage has usually rendered animals physically unhealthy; second, neutering to prevent the production of more roaming animals; then, having been neutered and rehabilitated, benefactors can put the animals back into where they belonged or help them find adaptation. Through mercy and humanity, TNR is the best way of reducing the populations of stray cats without any massacres and blood-shedding scenes. Moreover, complaints are reduced when cats no longer experience their oestrus (which is often correlated with noises and foul odors).

For years, researchers and animal lovers have been assessing this method in different ways. From 1998-2005, researchers at Randolph University carried out a comparison between six TNR colonies and 3 unsterilized colonies[3]. By the end of the experiment, one colony that formerly had 10 cats was reduced to none and another colony of 10 reduced to one[4]. Similar research is carried out during 1991-2002 in University of Central Florida. The students there held 155 cats and practiced TNR to them. By the end of 11 years, the number reduced to 6[5].

Although the results of TNR seemed outstanding, many practitioners were stalled in the first step of TNR — Trap.

Start cats are famous for their wildness and never succumbing. This disposition has led to maniac revolts and self-injuring destructions when people try to trap them. All being animal lovers, people who carry out TNR always put the welfare of cats in the first place. The risks of injuring the cats had often back them off, even when capturing them is for their higher benefits. Thus, the success of TNR is limited by how well the stray cats would react to a trap.

This practical issue must be overcome if people long a safe and effective way of protecting and annihilating cats, which has brought us the idea of improving the tool for TNR.

Applied Design—“Kitty Wonderland”

Having noticed it was the difficulty in capturing cats that largely impeded the executive of TNR, we realized that the feline-attracting characteristic of nepetalactone could be of great help. (For more details on why nepetalactone appeals felines, see Project Background) Compared to cage traps and usual food lure, the pleasant scent of nepetalactone in catnip would appear to cats less of a pitfall, therefore more easily let down the guard of stray cats. With this need clearly identified, we devised brand new hardware which can attract and seize stray cats when needed, provide cats with comfortable and secure shelter, and contains an auto feeder to reduce the workload of the volunteered caregivers. With a beautiful wish that this device would be promised land for the roaming cats, we named it “Kitty Wonderland.”

Hardware

In order to solve the stray cats problem, we devise this hardware, the Kitty Wonderland, to provide homeless stray cats with shelters which could offer them a safe, comfortable and permanent living environment. Through the interviews and discussions we made with specialists, officials and residence, we improve our hardware to combine the merits of existing methods like Trap&Neuter&Release. The hardware assists volunteered caregivers by attracting stray cats and capturing them if necessary, so the difficulties and costs in tracking and taking care of stray cats are greatly reduced. Besides, we apply nepetalactol, which is the focus of our project, to our hardware to make it more effective in attracting cats and emphasize the significance of our project. Finally, our hardware can be easily deployed on various locations in the community where it stresses the stray cats problem to a broad population in an original approach.


Integrated Human Practice

Stray cat is a thorny problem, but we proposed an innovative solution coherent to our project. Through a number of online and field research, we perceived the severity of this problem and broadened our perspective. We thoughtfully incorporated ‘value sensitive design’ throughout our human practice, connecting different stakeholders from the society. In practice, we communicated with stray cat rescue teams for advice, and collaborated with organisations like Maker Space and environmental NGOs to get more information, and furthermore, raise public awareness on this issue. We interviewed many citizens to collect comprehensive opinions and suggestions, which make our design more viable. Moreover, we inquired laws and regulations from relevant governmental departments to community level in order to ensure smooth implementation of our applied design. Above all, we have made a series of documentary about our human practice and the process of conceiving, building and improving our applied design: “Kitty Wonderland”.


Public engagement

We hosted a workshop on synbio and its application, and hold an exhibition of our project in the international Maker Faire. We discussed with audiences including artists, students, investors and engineers who inquired about the safety and potential of synbio eagerly. And engineers and artists established long-term collaboration with us on applied design. We closely engaged with the neighbourhood, urban management agencies and animal welfare groups, presenting how a microbial factory can integrate with cat shelter we built to solve the problem of feral cats. Through direct interviews, in-depth conversations, presentations or polls, we learnt their concerns and how synbio-related design can be better accepted by the public. Innovatively, we connect with people in the art field by holding activities which allow the public to draw and design the cat shelter. Moreover, we filmed a series of documentaries to reach even further, by uploading them on popular media platforms.


Documentary

Our design and the whole story of our human practice is in fact, not merely confined in the 1,000 words we have written above. During the way to the proceeding of our lab project as well as our endeavor to let the world improve our project and meanwhile influencing the world, we have done a lot. We record and recall the entire story and make it into a documentary series. The documentary shows how we spared no efforts to conceive our human practice and communicate with the externality to contribute to solving the stray cat problem.

                        <p class="flow-text">Immediately after we had come up with the overall draft of our project, we contacted some renowned people in clinical medicine, which we believe could benefit most from our project.

Their feedback could help us a lot in the optimization of our project.</p>
                        <h3>Dr. Yu from the Institute of Immunology</h3>
                        <img class="right-on-med-and-up width40" src="http://2018.igem.org/wiki/images/8/8e/T--Fudan--public-section2-3.png">
                        <ul>
                            As an established immune cell researcher, his comments were mainly on comparison between our project and CAR-T. From the perspective of his research, he gave us several enlightening suggestions, summarized as follows:
                            <li>Compared to CAR-T, our project could make immune cells perform more complex tasks, or even solid tumor treatment, where CAR-T has limited effect</li>
                            <li>Regarding application, we can try to achieve an assorted ‘army’ of immune cells for combined cancer treatment</li>
                            <li> The early design of our logic circuits was not unified. This might cause inconveniences to users and limit its usage</li>
                            <li> We have to form a systematic debugging process, to reduce the experimental difficulty and improve efficiency in the lab</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>Dr. Bi from Department of Neurology of Changhai Hospital</h3>

                            Director Bi, as an expert in neurology, has a great interest in synthetic biology. She fully affirmed the potential of our project, but also expressed her doubts. She pointed out that the intensity of many cell membrane surface ligand in the brain might not be as strong as we had expected, especially in the early stages of disease development, so the input signal is often very weak. However, the early stage of neurological diseases is the most crucial time for successful treatment with better recovery potential. Therefore, if the clinical neurological applications of our project should work ideally, it requires us to adjust our system for higher sensitivity. Intrigued and excited by our project, she delightfully invited us to have another round of discussion after iGEM. </p>

                        <ul>
                            Director Yang has high hopes for our project’s application in precise cancer therapy. As an experienced surgeon and a clinical oncologist, he expressed his expectations and anxiety for new cancer treatments. His main concern was about the effectiveness and safety of our tools in cancer treatment, as summarized below:
                            <li> The more comprehensive function immune cells achieve, the larger and more complex the logic system has to be. The construction and delivery of such a system will be a big challenge.</li>
                            <li> Simplify and unify our design as much as possible to enhance robustness and to avoid unforeseen problems.</li>
                            <li> Enhance our target precision to prevent unnecessary damage to healthy tissues</li>
                        </ul>

                            Dr. Luo mainly engages in translational medical research on burnt skin regeneration. He proposed that one application of our project could try to achieve precisely controlled skin regeneration so that the repair activities of the engineered cells can be activated or terminated under certain situations. After this fruitful interview, we expressed our willingness to the relevant application design after we completed the project improvement, and our proposal was welcomed by him. At the same time, he put forward the following suggestions to us:<br/>In the transmembrane signal transduction process, the loss of signal may cause the activation signal to be too weak to activate the expression of the downstream target.<br/>In our early project design, some logic gates contain too many layers of regulation and expression. Therefore, it may face signal interference problems.

                            Stroke, as a high-risk cerebrovascular disease, has the characteristics of rapid onset, high mortality and poor prognosis. More importantly, the incidence of stroke has gradually increased in recent years and is becoming one of the leading causes of death and paralysis.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">Unfortunately, current treatments can only palliate damage to brain tissue through early hemostasis/vascular dredges.

                            Attempts have been made to repair brain tissue damage using stem cells. However, this approach has the following disadvantages:
                            <li>Stem cells that are not precisely controlled, therefore have a risk of tumor formation in the body</li>
                            <li>The effect of stem cell treatment is questionable, and the mechanism of its effect in vivo is not clear</li>
                            <li>At present, stem cells are mainly transported to the lesion through stereotactic annotation, which cannot treat deep brain damage</li>
                            <li>The inner/periphery of the brain tissue after necrosis lacks the microenvironment that stimulates stem cells to differentiate into neurons. Most necrotic brain tissue is filled with astrocytes and loses its function.</li>

                        <h3>Smart skin regeneration</h3>
                        <p class="flow-text">
                            In our discussions with Dr. Luo, we learned that the current tissue differentiation is mostly done in vitro, which leads to morphological mismatch and possible risk of immune rejection. Especially in skin replantation, in vitro induction means that patients need to endure long waits and insufficient efficiency of skin grafting. Also, the natural repair relies heavily on the previously infected tissue, which means that it is currently impossible to achieve complete sterility of the patient's skin surface. There is an urgent need in the clinic for an alternative method for skin replantation.
                        </p>
                        <p class="flow-text">From Dr. Luo’s unpublished research results, we learned that Smad3 is an essential signaling factor in skin regeneration. Its expression determines the differentiation fate of cells in different parts. We propose to build a Smad3 NIMPLY gate for mesenchymal cells. Engineered cells will achieve different differentiation stages at different sites, to make smart skin regeneration.</p>

                        Some of these applications still have a long to be realized, but they are feasible and could help these doctors solve the most urgent problems in their fields.

                        <p class="flow-text">In September, we conducted an Internet survey and collected results from over 580 people with different backgrounds. We found that these people are very interested in synthetic biology, but have difficulty to understand the text we provided. We hosted the Bio-Art display with Legos <a href="/Team:Fudan-TSI/Bio-Art">(please follow the link to check more details)</a>. With hands-on logic gates building experience, the Display publicized the modularity of the project, and we learned how to convey synthetic biology to the general public effectively.

                        We have interviewed doctors with different backgrounds to understand their common needs, and brainstormed concrete applications of our project, such as facilitating brain repair after stroke and promoting skin regeneration. We want other scientists could readily use our project; thus we consult with many experts, including structure biologists who work on membrane receptors. By interacting with different people, we have been continually inspired through communications and dialogs.

                        Understanding is the base of trust and support. We did a quick experiment by running <a href="/Team:Fudan-TSI/Sponsors#crowd">a-week long crowdfunding campaign (10/4 - 10/9)</a>. We described our project and potential applications, with links to our wiki pages. To our surprise, over 200 Internet backers in 6 days, although some of them are our friends and relatives. Agree well with our public debate; the public is very open and willing to try. A better living and a healthy body are all they want. We must always remember <i>why we initiated the research</i> and <i>why we work hard in the lab</i> - for the good of the people, including ourselves.</p>

                    <p class="flow-text" style="margin:0">Mutation library generation is critical for biological and medical research, but current methods cannot mutate a specific sequence continuously without manual intervention. Here we present a toolbox for <i>in vivo</i> continuous mutation library construction. First, the target DNA is transcribed into RNA. Next, our reverse transcriptase reverts RNA into cDNA, during which the target is randomly mutated by enhanced error-prone reverse transcription. Finally, the mutated version replaces the original sequence through recombination. These steps will be carried out iteratively, generating a random mutation library of the target with high efficiency as mutations accumulate along with bacterial growth. Our toolbox is orthogonal and provides a wide range of applications among various species. R-Evolution could mutate coding sequences and regulatory sequences, which enables the <i>in vivo</i> evolution of individual proteins or multiple targets at a time, promotes high-throughput research, and serves as a foundational advance to synthetic biology.
