# iGEM site
It was initially developed by Tian Huang for 2018, and later modified by Liang Cai for 2019.

## For wiki coder
The content of XXX.html should be copied into Team:Fudan-TSI/XXX page, keep {{Fudan-TSI}} but delete the jquery link before <html>

The site has a function to import jquery automatically, thus there is no need to import again.

The file etc-nginx.conf is for running a mirror site.

Both .py files could be used to running locally, very good for site building and testing. Run [the local site](http://127.0.0.1:8000) and start coding!
